# hwid-window-spoofer (windows only)

`cmd` scripting for spoofing your hardware-id with random-num to avoid another series of ban in online games/network etc.

use `wmic diskdrive/memorychip/baseboard get serialnumber` to double check the new serial num.

# current features 
1) re-generate new serial numbers for HDD/SDD, RAM and MOBO baseboard.
2) delete trace files & registry used in games, in this case only game I play included.

# future-mod
currently in seperate .bat files, might combine 'em all later.
1) change mac id
2) change username, pc workgroup etc
3) add more deletion of traces files for AAA-titles games.
