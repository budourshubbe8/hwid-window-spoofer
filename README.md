# hwid-window-spoofer (windows only)

`cmd` scripting for spoofing your hardware-id with random-num to avoid another series of ban in online games/network etc.

use `wmic diskdrive/memorychip/baseboard get serialnumber` to double check the new serial num.

# current features 
1) re-generate new serial numbers for HDD/SDD, RAM and MOBO baseboard.
2) delete trace files & registry used in games, in this case only game I play included.

# future-mod
currently in seperate files, might combine 'em all later.
1) spoof RAM serial num, mobo
2) change mac id
3) change username, pc workgroup etc
4) add more deletion of traces files for AAA-titles games.
